üîµ Just built a Transparent Donation Tracker using Base MCP! #basemcp

With just a conversation in Claude, you can now:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create donation campaigns for causes you care about
2Ô∏è‚É£ Accept USDC donations directly on Base
3Ô∏è‚É£ Track all donations transparently on-chain
4Ô∏è‚É£ Send personalized donation messages

This is the future of transparent, frictionless charity! AI + blockchain is a powerful combination for social good.

Code: https://github.com/[your-username]/base-mcp/pull/[pr-number]

I added 4 new MCP tools that make it incredibly easy to manage charity campaigns through natural language:
- create_donation_campaign
- make_donation
- get_campaign_details
- list_campaigns

Imagine being able to say to Claude: "Create a campaign to help build a community garden" and it's done instantly, on-chain, with full transparency!
