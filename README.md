# Transparent Donation Tracker for Base MCP ðŸ”µ

![Base MCP](https://base.org/brand/base-logo.svg)

A set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that allow Claude and other AI applications to create, manage, and interact with on-chain donation campaigns on the Base network. This extension enables transparent, verifiable charity fundraising using USDC on Base.

## Overview

This extension adds donation campaign functionality to Base MCP, allowing users to:

- Create donation campaigns for charitable causes
- Make USDC donations to campaigns directly on Base
- Track campaign progress, donors, and donations transparently
- View active and completed campaigns

All transactions are performed on-chain, ensuring complete transparency and traceability of funds.

## Features

- **Transparent Fundraising**: All donations are recorded on-chain, providing full transparency.
- **USDC Support**: Donations are made using USDC stablecoin on Base.
- **Campaign Management**: Create campaigns with descriptions, target amounts, and end dates.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time tracking of campaign progress and donation history.
- **Messaging**: Include personal messages with donations.

## Integration with Claude

Once installed, users can interact with the donation system through natural language:

```
"Create a donation campaign to help build a community garden."
"Donate 5 USDC to the disaster relief campaign."
"Show me details of the wildlife conservation campaign."
"List all active donation campaigns."
```

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Base MCP configuration.
2. Ensure you have a Base wallet with USDC available for donations.
3. Restart your Claude Desktop application.
